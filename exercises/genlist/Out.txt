 1.29e+02  2.48e+01  4.85e+00 
 8.86e+01  3.37e+01  7.78e+00 
 3.04e+01  9.98e+01  6.72e+00 
-1.33e+00  9.63e+01  2.23e+00 


 Let's attempt to remove a line from this table.
Here's the list without the second entry.
 1.29e+02  2.48e+01  4.85e+00 
 8.86e+01  3.37e+01  7.78e+00 
-1.33e+00  9.63e+01  2.23e+00 


Now we'll attempt to pop the last element and print it alone.
3-1.33e+00  9.63e+01  2.23e+00 
And here's the remaining list
 1.29e+02  2.48e+01  4.85e+00 
 8.86e+01  3.37e+01  7.78e+00
